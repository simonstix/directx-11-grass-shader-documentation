# Render Pipelines

## Universal Render Pipeline

Switching to URP is very straight forward. Simply select your grass material and change the shader to `Stix Games / Grass URP`.

## High-Definition Render Pipeline

HDRP is not supported yet. There is already some code, but it doesn't do anything remotely correct at the moment.
